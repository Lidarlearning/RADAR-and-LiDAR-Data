This repository provides curated datasets and simulation outputs for radar and LiDAR sensor studies, focusing on:

Radar Signal Distortion: Including simulated phase noise and third-order intermodulation distortion (IM3).

LiDAR Motion Distortion: Collected and preprocessed data showcasing the effects of sensor movement on point cloud accuracy.

Purpose
The aim of this repository is to support the development and benchmarking of signal processing, sensor fusion, and distortion compensation algorithms in the context of autonomous vehicles and robotic perception.

Contents
radar/phase_noise/ — Simulated radar phase noise datasets and scripts.

radar/im3_distortion/ — IM3 signal simulations and characteristics.

lidar/motion_distortion/ — LiDAR point cloud samples showing motion distortion (e.g., during dynamic scans).

notebooks/ — Jupyter notebooks or MATLAB for visualization and basic analysis.

docs/ — Project documentation and references.

Applications
Signal integrity analysis for FMCW and pulse radar.

Development of denoising and distortion compensation algorithms.

LiDAR calibration and synchronization validation.

Sensor fusion in autonomous systems.
